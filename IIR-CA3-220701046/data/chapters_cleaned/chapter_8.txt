“look five don’t go splashing paint like that” “i couldn’t help it” said five sulky tone “seven jogged elbow” seven looked said “that’s right five always lay blame others” “you’d better talk” said five “i heard queen say yesterday deserved beheaded” “what for” said one spoken first “that’s none business two” said seven “yes business” said five “and i’ll tell him—it bringing cook tuliproots instead onions” seven flung brush begun “well unjust things—” eye chanced fall upon alice stood watching checked suddenly others looked round also bowed low “would tell me” said alice little timidly “why painting roses” five seven said nothing looked two two began low voice “why fact see miss ought red rosetree put white one mistake queen find heads cut know see miss we’re best afore comes to—” moment five anxiously looking across garden called “the queen queen” three gardeners instantly threw flat upon faces sound many footsteps alice looked round eager see queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs shaped like three gardeners oblong flat hands feet corners next ten courtiers ornamented diamonds walked two two soldiers came royal children ten little dears came jumping merrily along hand hand couples ornamented hearts next came guests mostly kings queens among alice recognised white rabbit talking hurried nervous manner smiling everything said went without noticing followed knave hearts carrying king’s crown crimson velvet cushion last grand procession came king queen hearts alice rather doubtful whether ought lie face like three gardeners could remember ever heard rule processions “and besides would use procession” thought “if people lie upon faces couldn’t see it” stood still waited procession came opposite alice stopped looked queen said severely “who this” said knave hearts bowed smiled reply “idiot” said queen tossing head impatiently turning alice went “what’s name child” “my name alice please majesty” said alice politely added “why they’re pack cards needn’t afraid them” “and these” said queen pointing three gardeners lying round rosetree see lying faces pattern backs rest pack could tell whether gardeners soldiers courtiers three children “how know” said alice surprised courage “it’s business mine” queen turned crimson fury glaring moment like wild beast screamed “off head off—” “nonsense” said alice loudly decidedly queen silent king laid hand upon arm timidly said “consider dear child” queen turned angrily away said knave “turn over” knave carefully one foot “get up” said queen shrill loud voice three gardeners instantly jumped began bowing king queen royal children everybody else “leave that” screamed queen “you make giddy” turning rosetree went “what here” “may please majesty” said two humble tone going one knee spoke “we trying—” “i see” said queen meanwhile examining roses “off heads” procession moved three soldiers remaining behind execute unfortunate gardeners ran alice protection “you shan’t beheaded” said alice put large flowerpot stood near three soldiers wandered minute two looking quietly marched others “are heads off” shouted queen “their heads gone please majesty” soldiers shouted reply “that’s right” shouted queen “can play croquet” soldiers silent looked alice question evidently meant “yes” shouted alice “come then” roared queen alice joined procession wondering much would happen next “it’s—it’s fine day” said timid voice side walking white rabbit peeping anxiously face “very” said alice “—where’s duchess” “hush hush” said rabbit low hurried tone looked anxiously shoulder spoke raised upon tiptoe put mouth close ear whispered “she’s sentence execution” “what for” said alice “did say ‘what pity’” rabbit asked “no didn’t” said alice “i don’t think it’s pity said ‘what for’” “she boxed queen’s ears—” rabbit began alice gave little scream laughter “oh hush” rabbit whispered frightened tone “the queen hear see came rather late queen said—” “get places” shouted queen voice thunder people began running directions tumbling however got settled minute two game began alice thought never seen curious croquetground life ridges furrows balls live hedgehogs mallets live flamingoes soldiers double stand hands feet make arches chief difficulty alice found first managing flamingo succeeded getting body tucked away comfortably enough arm legs hanging generally got neck nicely straightened going give hedgehog blow head would twist round look face puzzled expression could help bursting laughing got head going begin provoking find hedgehog unrolled act crawling away besides generally ridge furrow way wherever wanted send hedgehog doubledup soldiers always getting walking parts ground alice soon came conclusion difficult game indeed players played without waiting turns quarrelling fighting hedgehogs short time queen furious passion went stamping shouting “off head” “off head” minute alice began feel uneasy sure yet dispute queen knew might happen minute “and then” thought “what would become they’re dreadfully fond beheading people great wonder there’s one left alive” looking way escape wondering whether could get away without seen noticed curious appearance air puzzled much first watching minute two made grin said “it’s cheshire cat shall somebody talk to” “how getting on” said cat soon mouth enough speak alice waited till eyes appeared nodded “it’s use speaking it” thought “till ears come least one them” another minute whole head appeared alice put flamingo began account game feeling glad someone listen cat seemed think enough sight appeared “i don’t think play fairly” alice began rather complaining tone “and quarrel dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and don’t seem rules particular least nobody attends them—and you’ve idea confusing things alive instance there’s arch i’ve got go next walking end ground—and croqueted queen’s hedgehog ran away saw mine coming” “how like queen” said cat low voice “not all” said alice “she’s extremely—” noticed queen close behind listening went “—likely win it’s hardly worth finishing game” queen smiled passed “who talking to” said king going alice looking cat’s head great curiosity “it’s friend mine—a cheshire cat” said alice “allow introduce it” “i don’t like look all” said king “however may kiss hand likes” “i’d rather not” cat remarked “don’t impertinent” said king “and don’t look like that” got behind alice spoke “a cat may look king” said alice “i’ve read book don’t remember where” “well must removed” said king decidedly called queen passing moment “my dear wish would cat removed” queen one way settling difficulties great small “off head” said without even looking round “i’ll fetch executioner myself” said king eagerly hurried alice thought might well go back see game going heard queen’s voice distance screaming passion already heard sentence three players executed missed turns like look things game confusion never knew whether turn went search hedgehog hedgehog engaged fight another hedgehog seemed alice excellent opportunity croqueting one difficulty flamingo gone across side garden alice could see trying helpless sort way fly tree time caught flamingo brought back fight hedgehogs sight “but doesn’t matter much” thought alice “as arches gone side ground” tucked away arm might escape went back little conversation friend got back cheshire cat surprised find quite large crowd collected round dispute going executioner king queen talking rest quite silent looked uncomfortable moment alice appeared appealed three settle question repeated arguments though spoke found hard indeed make exactly said executioner’s argument couldn’t cut head unless body cut never thing wasn’t going begin time life king’s argument anything head could beheaded weren’t talk nonsense queen’s argument something wasn’t done less time she’d everybody executed round last remark made whole party look grave anxious alice could think nothing else say “it belongs duchess you’d better ask it” “she’s prison” queen said executioner “fetch here” executioner went like arrow cat’s head began fading away moment gone time come back duchess entirely disappeared king executioner ran wildly looking rest party went back game
