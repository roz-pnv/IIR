arm great letter nearly large handed saying solemn tone “for duchess invitation queen play croquet” frogfootman repeated solemn tone changing order words little “from queen invitation duchess play croquet” bowed low curls got entangled together alice laughed much run back wood fear hearing next peeped fishfootman gone sitting ground near door staring stupidly sky alice went timidly door knocked “there’s sort use knocking” said footman “and two reasons first i’m side door secondly they’re making noise inside one could possibly hear you” certainly extraordinary noise going within—a constant howling sneezing every great crash dish kettle broken pieces “please then” said alice “how get in” “there might sense knocking” footman went without attending “if door us instance inside might knock could let know” looking sky time speaking alice thought decidedly uncivil “but perhaps can’t help it” said “his eyes nearly top head rate might answer questions—how get in” repeated aloud “i shall sit here” footman remarked “till tomorrow—” moment door house opened large plate came skimming straight footman’s head grazed nose broke pieces one trees behind “—or next day maybe” footman continued tone exactly nothing happened “how get in” asked alice louder tone “are get all” said footman “that’s first question know” doubt alice like told “it’s really dreadful” muttered “the way creatures argue it’s enough drive one crazy” footman seemed think good opportunity repeating remark variations “i shall sit here” said “on days days” “but do” said alice “anything like” said footman began whistling “oh there’s use talking him” said alice desperately “he’s perfectly idiotic” opened door went door led right large kitchen full smoke one end duchess sitting threelegged stool middle nursing baby cook
