feelings may different” said alice “all know would feel queer me” “you” said caterpillar contemptuously “who you” brought back beginning conversation alice felt little irritated caterpillar’s making short remarks drew said gravely “i think ought tell first” “why” said caterpillar another puzzling question alice could think good reason caterpillar seemed unpleasant state mind turned away “come back” caterpillar called “i’ve something important say” sounded promising certainly alice turned came back “keep temper” said caterpillar “is all” said alice swallowing anger well could “no” said caterpillar alice thought might well wait nothing else perhaps might tell something worth hearing minutes puffed away without speaking last unfolded arms took hookah mouth said “so think you’re changed you” “i’m afraid sir” said alice “i can’t remember things used—and don’t keep size ten minutes together” “can’t remember things” said caterpillar “well i’ve tried say “how doth little busy

content now” said caterpillar “well like little larger sir wouldn’t mind” said alice “three inches wretched height be” “it good height indeed” said caterpillar angrily rearing upright spoke exactly three inches high “but i’m used it” pleaded poor alice piteous tone thought “i wish creatures wouldn’t easily offended” “you’ll get used time” said caterpillar put hookah mouth began smoking time alice waited patiently chose speak minute two caterpillar took hookah mouth yawned twice shook got mushroom crawled away grass merely remarking went “one side make grow taller side make grow shorter” “one side side what” thought alice “of mushroom” said caterpillar asked aloud another moment sight alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute trying make two sides perfectly round found difficult question however last stretched arms round far would go broke bit edge hand “and which” said nibbled little righthand bit try effect next moment felt violent blow underneath chin struck foot good deal frightened sudden change felt time lost shrinking rapidly set work eat bit chin pressed closely foot hardly room open mouth last managed swallow morsel lefthand bit “come head’s free last” said alice tone delight changed alarm another moment found shoulders nowhere found could see looked immense length neck seemed rise like stalk sea green leaves lay far “what green stuff be” said alice “and shoulders got oh poor hands can’t see you” moving spoke result seemed follow except little shaking among distant green leaves seemed chance getting hands head tried get head delighted find neck would bend easily direction like serpent succeeded curving graceful zigzag going dive among leaves found nothing tops trees wandering sharp hiss made draw back hurry large pigeon flown face beating violently wings “serpent” screamed pigeon “i’m serpent” said alice indignantly “let alone” “serpent say again” repeated pigeon subdued tone added kind sob “i’ve tried every way nothing seems suit them” “i haven’t least idea you’re talking about” said alice “i’ve tried roots trees i’ve tried banks i’ve tried hedges” pigeon went without attending “but serpents there’s pleasing them” alice puzzled thought use saying anything till pigeon finished “as wasn’t trouble enough hatching eggs” said pigeon “but must lookout serpents night day haven’t wink sleep three weeks” “i’m sorry you’ve annoyed” said alice beginning see meaning “and i’d taken highest tree wood” continued pigeon raising voice shriek “and thinking free last must needs come wriggling sky ugh serpent” “but i’m serpent

gave pigeon opportunity adding “you’re looking eggs know well enough matter whether you’re little girl serpent” “it matters good deal me” said alice hastily “but i’m looking eggs happens shouldn’t want don’t like raw” “well then” said pigeon sulky tone settled nest alice crouched among trees well could neck kept getting entangled among branches every stop untwist remembered still held pieces mushroom hands set work carefully nibbling first one growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter succeeded bringing usual height long since anything near right size felt quite strange first got used minutes began talking usual “come there’s half plan done puzzling changes i’m never sure i’m going one minute another however i’ve got back right size next thing get beautiful garden—how done wonder” said came suddenly upon open place little house four feet high “whoever lives there” thought alice “it’ll never come upon size frighten wits” began nibbling righthand bit venture go near house till
