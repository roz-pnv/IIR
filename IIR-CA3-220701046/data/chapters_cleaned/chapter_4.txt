chapter iv rabbit sends little bill white rabbit trotting slowly back looking anxiously went lost something heard muttering “the duchess duchess oh dear paws oh fur whiskers she’ll get executed sure ferrets ferrets dropped wonder” alice guessed moment looking fan pair white kid gloves goodnaturedly began hunting nowhere seen—everything seemed changed since swim pool great hall glass table little door vanished completely soon rabbit noticed alice went hunting called angry tone “why mary ann run home moment fetch pair gloves fan quick now” alice much frightened ran direction pointed without trying explain mistake made “he took housemaid” said ran “how surprised he’ll finds i’d better take fan gloves—that find them” said came upon neat little house door bright brass plate name “w rabbit” engraved upon went without knocking hurried upstairs great fear lest meet real mary ann turned house found fan gloves “how queer seems” alice said “to going messages rabbit suppose dinah’ll sending messages next” began fancying sort thing would happen “‘miss alice come directly get ready walk’ ‘coming minute nurse i’ve got see mouse doesn’t get out’ don’t think” alice went “that they’d let dinah stop house began ordering people like that” time found way tidy little room table window hoped fan two three pairs tiny white kid gloves took fan pair gloves going leave room eye fell upon little bottle stood near lookingglass label time words “drink me” nevertheless uncorked put lips “i know something interesting sure happen” said “whenever eat drink anything i’ll see bottle hope it’ll make grow large really i’m quite tired tiny little thing” indeed much sooner expected drunk half bottle found head pressing ceiling stoop save neck broken hastily put bottle saying “that’s quite enough—i hope shan’t grow more—as can’t get door—i wish hadn’t drunk quite much” alas late wish went growing growing soon kneel floor another minute even room tried effect lying one elbow door arm curled round head still went growing last resource put one arm window one foot chimney said “now whatever happens become me” luckily alice little magic bottle full effect grew larger still uncomfortable seemed sort chance ever getting room wonder felt unhappy “it much pleasanter home” thought poor alice “when one wasn’t always growing larger smaller ordered mice rabbits almost wish hadn’t gone rabbithole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious know sort life wonder happened used read fairytales fancied kind thing never happened middle one ought book written ought grow i’ll write one—but i’m grown now” added sorrowful tone “at least there’s room grow here” “but then” thought alice “shall never get older that’ll comfort one way—never old woman—but then—always lessons learn oh shouldn’t like that” “oh foolish alice” answered “how learn lessons there’s hardly room room lessonbooks” went taking first one side making quite conversation altogether minutes heard voice outside stopped listen “mary ann mary ann” said voice “fetch gloves moment” came little pattering feet stairs alice knew rabbit coming look trembled till shook house quite forgetting thousand times large rabbit reason afraid presently rabbit came door tried open door opened inwards alice’s elbow pressed hard attempt proved failure alice heard say “then i’ll go round get window” “that won’t” thought alice waiting till fancied heard rabbit window suddenly spread hand made snatch air get hold anything heard little shriek fall crash broken glass concluded possible fallen cucumberframe something sort next came angry voice—the rabbit’s—“pat pat you” voice never heard “sure i’m digging apples yer honour” “digging apples indeed” said rabbit angrily “here come help this” sounds broken glass “now tell pat what’s window” “sure it’s arm yer honour” pronounced “arrum” “an arm goose ever saw one size fills whole window” “sure yer honour it’s arm that” “well it’s got business rate go take away” long silence alice could hear whispers “sure don’t like yer honour all” “do tell coward” last spread hand made another snatch air time two little shrieks sounds broken glass “what number cucumberframes must be” thought alice “i wonder they’ll next pulling window wish could i’m sure don’t want stay longer” waited time without hearing anything last came rumbling little cartwheels sound good many voices talking together made words “where’s ladder—why hadn’t bring one bill’s got other—bill fetch lad—here put ’em corner—no tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—oh they’ll well enough don’t particular—here bill catch hold rope—will roof bear—mind loose slate—oh it’s coming heads below” loud crash—“now that—it bill fancy—who’s go chimney—nay shan’t it—that won’t then—bill’s go down—here bill master says you’re go chimney” “oh bill’s got come chimney he” said alice “shy seem put everything upon bill wouldn’t bill’s place good deal fireplace narrow sure think kick little” drew foot far chimney could waited till heard little animal couldn’t guess sort scratching scrambling chimney close saying “this bill” gave one sharp kick waited see would happen next first thing heard general chorus “there goes bill” rabbit’s voice along—“catch hedge” silence another confusion voices—“hold head—brandy now—don’t choke him—how old fellow happened tell us it” last came little feeble squeaking voice “that’s bill” thought alice “well hardly know—no thank ye i’m better now—but i’m deal flustered tell you—all know something comes like jackinthebox goes like skyrocket” “so old fellow” said others “we must burn house down” said rabbit’s voice alice called loud could “if i’ll set dinah you” dead silence instantly alice thought “i wonder next sense they’d take roof off” minute two began moving alice heard rabbit say “a barrowful begin with” “a barrowful what” thought alice long doubt next moment shower little pebbles came rattling window hit face “i’ll put stop this” said shouted “you’d better again” produced another dead silence alice noticed surprise pebbles turning little cakes lay floor bright idea came head “if eat one cakes” thought “it’s sure make change size can’t possibly make larger must make smaller suppose” swallowed one cakes delighted find began shrinking directly soon small enough get door ran house found quite crowd little animals birds waiting outside poor little lizard bill middle held two guineapigs giving something bottle made rush alice moment appeared ran hard could soon found safe thick wood “the first thing i’ve got do” said alice wandered wood “is grow right size second thing find way lovely garden think best plan” sounded excellent plan doubt neatly simply arranged difficulty smallest idea set peering anxiously among trees little sharp bark head made look great hurry enormous puppy looking large round eyes feebly stretching one paw trying touch “poor little thing” said alice coaxing tone tried hard whistle terribly frightened time thought might hungry case would likely eat spite coaxing hardly knowing picked little bit stick held puppy whereupon puppy jumped air feet yelp delight rushed stick made believe worry alice dodged behind great thistle keep run moment appeared side puppy made another rush stick tumbled head heels hurry get hold alice thinking like game play carthorse expecting every moment trampled feet ran round thistle puppy began series short charges stick running little way forwards time long way back barking hoarsely till last sat good way panting tongue hanging mouth great eyes half shut seemed alice good opportunity making escape set ran till quite tired breath till puppy’s bark sounded quite faint distance “and yet dear little puppy was” said alice leant buttercup rest fanned one leaves “i liked teaching tricks much if—if i’d right size oh dear i’d nearly forgotten i’ve got grow let see—how managed suppose ought eat drink something great question what” great question certainly alice looked round flowers blades grass see anything looked like right thing eat drink circumstances large mushroom growing near height looked sides behind occurred might well look see top stretched tiptoe peeped edge mushroom eyes immediately met large blue caterpillar sitting top arms folded quietly smoking long hookah taking smallest notice anything else
