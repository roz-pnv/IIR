can’t possibly make larger must make smaller suppose” swallowed one cakes delighted find began shrinking directly soon small enough get door ran house found quite crowd little animals birds waiting outside poor little lizard bill middle held two guineapigs giving something bottle made rush alice moment appeared ran hard could soon found safe thick wood “the first thing i’ve got do” said alice wandered wood “is grow right size second thing find way lovely garden think best plan” sounded excellent plan doubt neatly simply arranged difficulty smallest idea set peering anxiously among trees little sharp bark head made look great hurry enormous puppy looking large round eyes feebly stretching one paw trying touch “poor little thing” said alice coaxing tone tried hard whistle terribly frightened time thought might hungry case would likely eat spite coaxing hardly knowing picked little bit stick held puppy whereupon puppy jumped air feet yelp delight rushed stick made believe worry

short remarks drew said gravely “i think ought tell first” “why” said caterpillar another puzzling question alice could think good reason caterpillar seemed unpleasant state mind turned away “come back” caterpillar called “i’ve something important say” sounded promising certainly alice turned came back “keep temper” said caterpillar “is all” said alice swallowing anger well could “no” said caterpillar alice thought might well wait nothing else perhaps might tell something worth hearing minutes puffed away without speaking last unfolded arms took hookah mouth said “so think you’re

incessantly stand head— think age right” “in youth” father william replied son “i feared might injure brain i’m perfectly sure none again” “you old” said youth “as mentioned grown uncommonly fat yet turned backsomersault door— pray reason that” “in youth” said sage shook grey locks “i kept limbs supple use ointment—one shilling box— allow sell couple” “you old” said youth “and jaws weak anything

suppose eye steady ever yet balanced eel end nose— made awfully clever” “i answered three questions enough” said father “don’t give airs think listen day stuff i’ll kick stairs” “that said right” said caterpillar “not quite right i’m afraid” said alice timidly “some words got altered” “it wrong beginning end” said caterpillar decidedly silence minutes caterpillar first speak “what size want be” asked “oh i’m particular size” alice hastily replied “only one doesn’t like changing often know” “i don’t know” said caterpillar alice said nothing never much contradicted life felt losing temper “are content now” said caterpillar “well like little larger sir wouldn’t mind” said alice “three inches wretched height be” “it good height indeed” said caterpillar angrily rearing upright spoke exactly three inches high “but i’m used it” pleaded poor alice piteous tone thought “i wish creatures wouldn’t easily offended” “you’ll get used time” said caterpillar put hookah mouth began smoking time alice waited patiently chose speak minute two caterpillar took hookah mouth yawned twice shook got mushroom crawled away grass merely remarking went “one side make grow taller side make grow shorter” “one side side what” thought alice “of mushroom” said caterpillar asked aloud another moment sight alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute trying make two sides perfectly round found difficult question however last stretched arms round far would go broke bit edge hand “and which” said nibbled little righthand bit try effect next moment felt violent blow underneath chin struck foot good deal frightened sudden change felt time lost shrinking rapidly set work eat bit chin pressed closely foot hardly room open mouth last managed swallow morsel lefthand bit “come head’s free last” said alice tone delight changed alarm another moment found shoulders nowhere found could see looked immense length neck seemed rise like stalk sea green leaves lay far “what green stuff be” said alice “and shoulders got oh poor hands can’t see you” moving spoke result seemed follow except little shaking among distant green leaves seemed chance getting hands head tried get head delighted find neck

indeed” said pigeon tone deepest contempt “i’ve seen good many little girls time never one neck you’re serpent there’s use denying suppose you’ll telling next never tasted egg” “i tasted eggs certainly” said alice truthful child “but little girls eat eggs quite much serpents know” “i don’t believe it” said pigeon “but they’re kind serpent that’s say” new idea alice quite silent minute two gave pigeon opportunity adding “you’re looking eggs know well enough matter whether you’re little girl serpent” “it matters good deal me” said alice hastily “but i’m looking eggs happens shouldn’t want don’t like raw” “well then” said pigeon sulky tone settled nest alice crouched among trees well could neck kept getting entangled among branches every stop untwist remembered still held pieces mushroom hands set work carefully nibbling first one growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter succeeded bringing usual height long since anything near right size felt quite strange first got used
